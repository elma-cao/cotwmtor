**Open Source Game Clones**

So I got bored at some stage and started exploring the project setings in github. Turns out Github tracks where traffic to my project comes from and one of them just happens to be from [http://osgameclones.com/](http://osgameclones.com/).

I checked these guys out and they are a OS site that collects links to OS game remakes! Surprise surprise, I found my remake on the list! Not only that, they actually found me August 31st last year. That's about a month after the project was created and two days after this blog site. Pretty awesome. So go check them out for other [open source games](http://osgameclones.com/).

**Castleofthewinds.com**

I guess this post is going to be a friends' list and I don't remember mentioning this before so yeah. A couple of weeks back, Meteor canned their free hosting. I had to move from a cotwmtor.meteor.com to cotwmtor.meteorapp.com and started paying USD$25 for hosting, that's about AUD$40/month. So I went looking for host names and found [castleofthewinds.com](http://castleofthewinds.com)! This is how I met [Sean Perryman](https://github.com/sean-perryman), also a fan of the game and owner of the domain.

We got talking and he offered to host the game or point the domain to whichever host I decide on (decision based on the least painful way to get deployment setup and maintained). So sometime in the near future, it'll be awesome to put the game on castleofthewinds.com rather than cotwmtor.meteorapp.com 

**Buy/sell**

I've been working on the buy/sell feature. Had to do alot more refactorings of the code to get there. I'm also getting better with testing, up to 99 tests. Had my BA (Business Analyst) write up some specs for the coin handling mechanics such as 'when buying, take from the smallest denomination first'. Check out the progress on this [trello card](https://trello.com/c/yHCD2TfY/13-5-buy-sell-1).
