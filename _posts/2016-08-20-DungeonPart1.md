## Still alive

For the avid readers of this blog, for which I'm sure are literally *countless*, I do apologise for being silent so long! There are two reasons that I hadn't made any updates:

1. I am in the middle of what I think is one of the largest features of the game and wanted to complete it in a week then give a full picture in one post. That was a month ago.
2. Everytime I fire up my dev machine, the urge to code overrides the urge to splurge so I add another little feature and neglect this devlog for another day.

However, both of these are very bad excuses for not keeping the fans ![github stars](/cotwmtor/images/fans.png) (for which I have *seventeen* of them!) updated on my progress, so without further ado... actually... my daughter's just climbed onto my lap demanding my attention and my wife is bugging me to go... what an anti-climax.
