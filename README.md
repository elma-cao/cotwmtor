# Castle of the Winds Remake #
Castle of the Winds is a tile-based RPG made by Rick Saada in the late 80s. Many old school RPGers remember the game with fond memories and as such, this the second attempt to port the game into the modern era to be playable on mobile and web browsers. 
There is a devlog detailing the making of this remake here: http://mordra.github.io/cotwmtor/
