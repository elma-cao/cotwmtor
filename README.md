# Castle of the Winds Remake #
Castle of the Winds is a tile-based RPG made by Rick Saada in the late 80s. Many old school RPGers remember the game with fond memories and as such, this is my second attempt to port the game into the modern era to be playable on mobile and web browsers.

**Note:** Meteor takes a minute to fire up so if you hit the loading screen, it isn't broken.

There is a devlog detailing the making (aka my rants) of this remake here: http://mordra.github.io/cotwmtor/
